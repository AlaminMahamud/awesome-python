collections
===========

1. namedtuple - factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields.
2. deque - list like container with fast appends and pops on either end
3. ChainMap - dict like class for craeting a single view of multiple mappings.
4. Counter - dict subclass for counting hashable objects
5. OrderedDict - dir subclass that remembers the order entries were added.
6. defaultdict - dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values.
7. UserDict - wrapper around dict objects for easier dict subclassing.
8. UserList - wrapper around list objects for easier list subclassing
9. UserString - wrapper around str objects for easier str subclassing

ChainMap
---------
```python
import builtins
from collections import ChainMap

pylookup = ChainMap(locals(), globals(), vars(builtins))
```


```python
import os, argparse
defaults = {'color':'red', 'user':'guest'}
parser = argparse. 
```
