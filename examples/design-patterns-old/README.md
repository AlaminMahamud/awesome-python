## Creational Design Patterns
### Simple Factory
Real World Example
```
Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. It would be a mess if every time you need a door, you put on your carpenter clothes and start making a door in your house. Instead you get it made from a factory.
```

In Plain Words
```
Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client
